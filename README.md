13. In cmd - mongoimport --uri mongodb+srv://materagarwal:aicteHello147@cluster0.h29aktp.mongodb.net/RealEstateYoutube --collection Residency --type json --jsonArray --file Residency.json

14. On Windows, the notation ./ is typically used on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS). On Windows, you should use backslashes \ instead. Also, make sure the MongoDB tools directory is included in your system's PATH environment variable.

Try running the command without the ./ notation:




## Commands used - 

1. cd server
2. npx prisma db push
3. npx prisma generate - this will update fields users and residency in mongoDB
